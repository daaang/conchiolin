conchiolin
==========

[![Build Status][status-image]][travis]
[![Test Coverage][cover-image]][coverage]

Molluscs slowly secrete chitin and conchiolin, which harden into their
shells. The outermost layor is usually entirely conchiolin, which is a
protein hardened with calcium carbonate.

This project is called conchiolin, and it produces its own shell
scripts.

It is currently in early development and isn't anywhere even close to
done.
